SECOND: Call the 'api_client_creation_guidelines' tool to understand the API client structure and requirements\n3. THIRD: Generate code that follows BOTH sets of guidelines\n\nWhen generating:\n- Use Portuguese for business terms (e.g., 'ecommerce' → 'EcommerceService')\n- Use English for technical terms (Repository, Service, Client)\n- Follow the DTO field naming rules (business fields in Portuguese)\n- Apply the API client structure patterns\n\nPlease specify:\n- Service name (use Portuguese for business domains)\n- Base URL of the API\n- Any specific endpoints or entities needed"
